The project is an Android application developed in [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), which represents BrewDog beer catalogue via [Punk API](https://punkapi.com). In this app you can view the entire catalog of BrewDog kinds of beer (data stored locally after first loading), view detailed information about each kind of beer, as well as add it to favorites.
